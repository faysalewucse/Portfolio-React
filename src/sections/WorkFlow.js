              I always follow specific steps when Iâ€™m working on a design
              project. In this way I can keep everything organised and it
              creates moments to talk about the project with my clients.

              For the Project at first I mostly ask questions and talk with my
              clients about what and how they want to complete their project. I
              want to get a super clear ideae of what they want and need. Only
              then can I deliver a product that both parties are happy with.
